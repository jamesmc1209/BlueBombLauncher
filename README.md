# BlueBombLauncher
An extension of bluebomb-helper.sh from wii.guide.

Installation:

Open Terminal and enter:
    wget https://wii.guide/assets/files/bluebomb-helper.sh
After it downloads the file enter:
    chmod +x bluebomb-helper.sh
Then:
    ./bluebomb-helper.sh

Now all the required dependencies will be downloaded.
After they have finished you will now see the Bluebomb Launcher on your desktop.

I modified the bluebomb-helper.sh from wii.guide to download the bluebomb icon from wii.guide as well as the bluebomb.desktop file from this repo.
It adds a desktop launcher that just opens the .sh file in terminal.
I needed this when my wii mini wasnt wanting to connect to my pc or raspi running the exploit. And I had to keep retrying the exploit.

Also probably should specify that Im using Ubuntu 18.04.
Note: I did not create the bluebomb-helper.sh I only injected a few lines of code for the launcher to work.
